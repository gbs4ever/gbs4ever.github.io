This blog is more for those just starting and exploring different languages and not sure where to start. My advice is just to pick an OO language like Ruby or Python and learn it well. Don’t jump around and try to learn the newest framework like react.js, vue.js, etc. or any of the newest popular and hottest things. Learn the basics of programming in general and understand it at is core only then move on.Programming is not just about the language but truelogic and problem-solving. You need to condition your mind process and think differently.

Top ten things to focus on.

1. [Read this](  www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/front-end-vs-back-end-developers-what-are-the-differences

Coding can be fun and frustrating at the same time ,sounds weird like either you like it or you hate it. Well welcome to be being a true developer, the frustration is our minds trying to learn and retain new concepts.The fun comes from seeing how much we can do with programming. To all future dev’s ,**do not, I repeat do not let the frustration kill that love and passion you have for coding !! As you move along hopefully there will be less frustration.**
