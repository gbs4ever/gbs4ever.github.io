As I am progressing in my learning and becoming more proficient in node.js. I took a step back and thought: “How well do I understand the core concepts of javascript?” 

As I am progressing in my learning and becoming more proficient in node.js. I took a step back and thought: “How well do I understand the core concepts of javascript”? Then I realized I should go back and review flatirons updated V8 JS section and review all those concepts. (Lexical Scoping, block scope, Is JS really a OO language, how bugs are created with Var)



 Is it really important to understand these concepts or maybe just knowing the syntax and what it will do should be fine? Well that is so far from the truth and I would say against one of my core principals . A good programmer knows what is code is trying to do, don’t just copy and paste from Stack overflow without learning it . Take the extra five min to read and understand your skills and knowledge will not just double. This will help you building good clean code and debugging when the code doesn’t behave like “you thought”.You need to condition your mind process and think differently.
 
 When you have gotten your first job (which you will) keep in mind you will be thrown into a codebase that is huge and it will feel like you are taking a drink of water from a water hose. Just keep your head above and know you have mad skills and strengths. Don’t let your weakness define you(we all have them). Make sure to work extra hard to up your skills and fix them.
