What is authorization and authentication, why is it important and some ways they can be hacked?
Authentication is confirming you are who you claim to be, this is the typical login process. Where we match your  input username and password against the DB if  is correct
Authorization is when we know who you are, but what rights or access do you have to this system are you an admin with full access pass or maybe you only have read rights. 

To give an example, imagine you try to go to a government security building. You come with your ticket and id to get it that is Authentication. The employee checks your ticket to see what permissions you have are your VIP, vendor, all-access. Where can you go, which floors can you access?  The employee gives you a neck badge to wear with your status that is your Authorization. The same process in with user credentials.

The better you understand this, it will help you understand where and what a hacker will try to exploit.
1. SQL Injection.
2. Phishing.
3. Stealing cookie.
4. Trying default / easy to guess usernames and passwords.
5. Is the login page is in the HTTPS? What if the attacker trys to  inject a keylogger?
6. Is the credentials sent over HTTPS? made in the middle ?
