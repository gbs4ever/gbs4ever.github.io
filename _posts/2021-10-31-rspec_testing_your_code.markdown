There are many articles written about why testing is important and needed to be able to build production-ready applications. For example, they will save your hours of debugging and easier to refactor saving your company millions, etc.

All These reasons are true however in my opinion there is one fundamental reason that is even more important. When you have to write a Unit Test it makes you rethink not just “I hope this code works with your fingers crossed “. It forces you to think about; What will this method/function do? What is the expected input and output? What data type is the input? Is my code really dry and clean?

Because even if you never ever run the test you have just accomplished worlds just by answering these questions
